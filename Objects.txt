Objects :
       
       In javascript , almost everything is an object. 
       Objects are variables too. But objects can contain many values.
       Object values are written as name : value pairs (name and value separated by a colon)



	let person = {firstName:"karthik",
	              lastName:"P",
	              age:25, 
	              eyeColor:"brown"};
	              
	const favNumbers = [7,14,18];



    Here firstName , lastName, age and eyeColor are object keys and karthik , P , 25 and brown are object values.

    And then ,Arrays are created with three different numbers 
    Here 7,14 and 18 are in the index of elemnet 0,1, and 2 respectively.
